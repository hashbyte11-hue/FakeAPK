Detecting Fake Banking APK 
An Android Package Kit (APK) is the file format used to distribute and install applications on Android devices, especially in mobile banking, where they are prime targets for attackers due to sensitive data. Despite using mechanisms like app signing, HTTPS, and Play Protect, APKs remain vulnerable to flaws such as unauthorized permissions, repackaging, reverse engineering,malicious third-party downloads and 0-day exploit, often leading to data theft and fraud. To address these issues, We propose an approach which encompasses Source Authentication and Code integrity during prior installation to detect tampering, and Digital Signature Verification to validate authenticity. Only when these three checks pass then the APK is installed, ensuring stronger protection against malicious files, reducing cyberattacks, and building customer trust in secure mobile banking applications.
